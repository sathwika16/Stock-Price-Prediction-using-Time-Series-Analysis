# üìà ME228 Final Project: Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
## üìù Project Description

This project implements a deep learning approach to predict stock prices using historical financial data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The focus is on **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** stock, and the model is built using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly suited for time series forecasting.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```

2. **Open the notebook**:

   ```
   projectma228.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run all cells** to fetch data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate results.
